## Lab 1: Motion Task

### [IR Short Distance Sensor](https://youtu.be/YJtl8nKCycc?t=7)
The robot incorporated 3 IR short distance sensors in the range of 2-10 inches each (4-30cm) positioned at the front, left, and right of the robot. The value of all sensors needed to be converted to actual distance measurements in inches and shown on the LCD, clearly stating the sensor name and distance in inches. 

### [IR Long Distance Sensor](https://youtu.be/YJtl8nKCycc?t=81)
The incorporated an IR long distance sensors in the range of 8-59 inches (20-150cm) positioned at the front of the robot. The sensor measurement value needed to be converted to distance in inches and displayed on the LCD as a single measurement between 2-59 inches. 

### [Open Loop Control Motor](https://youtu.be/YJtl8nKCycc?t=101)
The robot had to perform four different open loop motions without using any sensor information:
- Straight forward
- Straight backward
- Clockwise circle
- Counter-clockwise circle.

For the straight-line requirements, the robot needed to move between two 70-inch tapes as straight as possible without sensing the tapes. Circular movement was evaluated putting a mark at 30 inches from every robot side.

### [Square Open Loop Movement](https://youtu.be/YJtl8nKCycc?t=141)
The robot needed to move following two square trajectories having 30 inches of every side. The robot was not allowed to sense the tape.

### [Figure-8 Open Loop Movement](https://youtu.be/YJtl8nKCycc?t=170)
The robot was required to move through a figure-8 path having 30 inches in diameter. The movements were evaluated using deviation from the tape. The robot was not allowed to sense the tape.
